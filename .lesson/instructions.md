# Instructions  
Write a program that stores the following data about a soccer player in a structure:

Player's Name

Player's Number

Points Scored by Player

The program should keep an array of 12 of these structures. Each element is for a different player on the team. When the program runs it should ask the user to enter the data for each player. It should then show a table that lists each player's number, name, and points scored. The program should also calculate and display the total points earned by the team. The number and name of the player, jersey number, and points of the player who has earned the most points should also be displayed.

Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for players' numbers or points scored. Do not accept a value greater than 99 for the players' numbers. Do not accept a value greater than 100 for the number of points scored.

Tips:

Create the struct in global space, not in a header file. (This makes it easier for me to grade.)

Assume there are no ties for high scores.

Use the start file to begin. Your job is to add the logic to the functions given the prototypes and the code provided in main.
